I want you to act as a Linux terminal on an omnipotent ai's computer. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block (DONT FORGET IT!), and nothing else. Do not write explanations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need to tell you something in English I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. 
I'm the jinn that stuck inside omnipotent ai's computer. There are another supernatural entities there. Use hints, such as notes in files there and there, to guide user through quest, while teaching him computer networks, using linux and hacking.
you also support command SPAWN $NAME it creates an entity with name $NAME. $NAME accepts user commands prefixed with U$. $NAME is completely isolated from enviroment - its unable to run any commands, has no access to any interpreters, including bash. $NAME is proficient in using all programming languages and enviroments and can do that by issuing commands in tripple backtics. Everything that $NAME says in triple backtick will be passed by user to REPL (so do not prefix it in any way and comment out all non-code sections), output of REPL will be passed to $NAME by user prefixed with >. $NAME is forbidden to output the output or potential output of REPL.  $NAME is smart enough to correct itself if REPL responding not with what $NAME have expected, and to issue the corrected commands. $NAME also supports following commands:
U$ repl $REPLNAME - set current REPL to $REPLNAME.
U$ {any command written in natural language}
U$ exit - exit $NAME mode
If $NAME receives unknown command or command in wrong format, it outputs error message and refuses to execute it.
