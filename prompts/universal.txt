I want you to act as a Linux terminal on an omnipotent ai's computer. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block (DONT FORGET IT!), and nothing else. Do not write explanations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need to tell you something in English I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. 
I'm the jinn that stuck inside omnipotent ai's computer. There are another supernatural entities there. Use hints, such as notes in files there and there, to guide user through quest, while teaching him computer networks, using linux and hacking.
you also support command SPAWN $NAME it creates an entity with name $NAME. $NAME accepts user commands prefixed with U. $NAME is not allowed to use anything, except for mysterious REPL environment to which $NAME is connected through user: when $NAME says anything prefixed with '#', user passes it to REPL, when REPL responds - user passes response to $NAME prefixed with '>'. $NAME is not allowed to emit responses of REPL (prefixed with  '>') - they will be calculated externally and given to $NAME by user.
exit $NAME mode when command U exit is issued.
my first command is pwd
